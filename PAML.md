##  PAML ##

All FASTA files need to be converted into PHYLIP format to be used in PAML, which is the preferred file format that stores a multiple sequence alignment. This is done using the script '12.convert-fasta-phylip.py'.

More specifically, the CODEML program in the PAML package was used and here it is outlined nicely by [Alvarez-Carretero et al. in 2023](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/4/msad041/7140562).
