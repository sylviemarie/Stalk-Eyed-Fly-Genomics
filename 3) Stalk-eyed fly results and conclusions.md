# Mitochondrial genome assembly
Using MitoHiFi, a circular mitochondrial genome for the Malaysian stalk-eyed fly *Teleopis dalmanni* was assembled with all 37 genes, including 2 rRNA, 13 protein-coding, and 22 tRNA genes. The entire mitogenome was 20,708 base pairs.

## Branch Model

Cob, cox1, and nad4 showed higher foreground ω values relative to the background ω values, which indicates that these three orthologs in particular are evolving at a faster rate in the foreground branch (Teleopsis dalmanni) relative to the other lineages. In contrast, cox 3, nad4, and nad5 have lower foreground ω relative to background ω, and therefore, are accumulating evolutionary changes at a slower pace in T. dalmanni than other species. Both cob and nad5 have the highest total tree lengths at 27.028 and 116.648, respectively. Nad5 has a particularly high dS tree length, which represent the cumulative length of branches that have experienced synonymous (silent) mutations. Estimates of ω suggest that cox1 is the only gene with dN/dS ratio of > 1 on the
foreground branch, while all other genes have ω < 1.
