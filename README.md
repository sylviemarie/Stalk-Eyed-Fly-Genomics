# Stalk-eyed fly mitochondrial genome assembly and analysis 
The mitochondrial genome will be assembled and annotated for _Teleopsis dalmanni_ to aid in a larger project using single-cell RNA sequencing on male gonad samples to investigate the genomic basis of meiotic drive in stalk-eyed flies. Following the assembly, the mitogenome will be used in a comparative genomic  analysis with five other insects across three orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera) to detect signatures of positive selection and calculate evolutionary rates. This project will be split into three sections: 1) mitogenome assembly, 2) mitogenome analysis, and 3) detecting positive selection and calculating evolutionary rates in the stalk-eyed fly mitochondrial genes.

Mitochondrial genes encode **essential** proteins involved in cellular metabolism, bioenergetics (energy production/storage/consumption), and signalling pathways. Many studies have shown that miotchondrial genes can evolve under positive selection, driving adaptation and diversification, under environmental fluctuations. When environmental conditions are unstable, modifiying and optimizing mitochondrial processes can be essential in mediating adaptation.
