# Stalk-eyed fly mitochondrial genome assembly and analysis 
The mitochondrial genome will be assembled and annotated for _Teleopsis dalmanni_ to aid in a larger project using single-cell RNA sequencing on male gonad samples to investigate the genomic basis of meiotic drive in stalk-eyed flies. Following the assembly, the mitogenome will be used in a comparative genomic  analysis with five other insects across three orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera) to detect signatures of positive selection and calculate evolutionary rates.
