# Stalk-eyed fly mitochondrial genome assembly and analysis 
The mitochondrial genome will be assembled and annotated for _Teleopsis dalmanni_ to aid in a larger project using single-cell RNA sequencing on male gonad samples to investigate the genomic basis of meiotic drive.

This repository will contain:
- Notes and scripts for running MitoHiFi 
- Reference genome fasta and genbank files
- Mitochondrial genome analysis pipeline
- Python scripts for mitogenome analysis
- Results from mitogenome analysis, etc.
